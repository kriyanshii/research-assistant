                      <p>We have designed an aid for the everyday researcher and knowledge gatherer. You never have to comb through a sea of text trying to find that one statistic, that one conclusion that can win you an argument or complete your citation. Just plug those lengthy pdfs into this tool and ask questions to your very own research assistant (at a salary: Rs. 0/hr impressive, right?).</br>
                        A user can upload a number of well-formatted (mostly plaintext) PDFs. This tool is focused on research papers due to their standard format, making it very easy to extract text. Also, the need for such a tool is greater because research papers tend to have a lot of data and sifting through many research papers to obtain data related to a query can become tedious.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">How does it work?</h3>
                    <div class="answer">
                      <p>The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate text based on user input. The user provides a prompt, and the app uses the model to generate a text response. The user can then edit the response as needed and use it for their desired purpose.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">Is my data safe?</h3>
                    <div class="answer">
                      <p>Yes, your data is safe. The app does not store any user data on our servers, and all data is processed locally on the user's device. We also use encryption to ensure that all data transmission is secure.</p>
